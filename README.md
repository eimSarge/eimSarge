ğŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Stone â€“ founder of a digital marketing agency that helps U.S.-based manufacturers grow through smart advertising, sharp websites, and streamlined systems. Iâ€™m lucky to work with a talented team of specialists who know how to turn strategy into measurable results. We donâ€™t just follow best practicesâ€”we build them.
Here are some ideas to get you started:

ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Artificial Intelligence applications for the manufacturing industry.

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about fine-tuning language models and automating quoting workflows.

ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on AI-driven tools, ERP integrations, and lead generation systems for manufacturers.

ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with building AI agents to accelerate and scale software development workflows.

ğŸ’¬ Ask me about digital strategy for B2B manufacturers, HubSpot automation, or creative uses of GPT in marketing.

ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him

âš¡ Fun fact: I can quote lines from Caddyshack, write a Google Ads script, and grill the perfect ribeyeâ€”all before lunch.
